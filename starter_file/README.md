## Labor Prediction Model

For glass installation companies, accurately esimtating how long an installation will take to complete is critical to pricing a job. This model predicts how long a glass installation will take.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
The data is culled from a real glass company's database and was carefully selected to achieve optimum results.

### Task
The model predicts how long a job will take based on the following features:
Glass height - how tall the glass is
Glass width - how wide the glass is
Frame material - what the frame holding the glass is made out of
Frame function - what the frame holding the glass actually is (ex. slider, fixed, sash....)
Lift - how high up the glass is
Set - what material is used to keep the glass in the frame
Location type - what kind of place the installation is taking place in (ex. residential, hospital, school...)
Lead Mechanic - who did the installation
Long Carry - whether they had to carry the glass over a long distance

### Access
The data is uploaded to the Azure workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
